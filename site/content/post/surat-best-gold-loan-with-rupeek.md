A fast-emerging trend in securing quick financial fixes is availing of a gold loan. Gold — which you’d generally find sitting inside bank lockers — is being pulled out and used for its advantage of its lucre. Interestingly, information available on gold loans is vague, leaving you a little muddled up about the detailed process on gold loan sanction. So, where do you begin?

The first step is to figure out your gold loan eligibility. Many banks and Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) that offer gold loans have online calculators for this, but then the question really is, how to get max principal amount on gold loan? Here’s a quick, 3 step guide to know all about your loan eligibility:

## 1. Understanding The Per Gram Rate And The LTV

It is important to know the value of gold per gram, which is the current rate of 22 Carat gold in the market on the day of availing the loan, to know your loan eligibility. Once you’re armed with this information, the gold loan rate per gram is based on something called the LTV or loan to value ratio.

The simplest way to define the LTV is that it is the maximum loan amount that can be availed, basis the underlying value of the gold. Simply put, the LTV determines whether you’re going to get Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 5 lakh on the value of the gold. The standard maximum LTV that can be availed on gold is set by the Reserve Bank of India at 75%. This means that based on the value of your gold and the per gram rate, you could get a loan of up to 75% of the value of your gold.

To understand the amount you can get based on the value of your gold, therefore, knowing the per gram rate and the LTV ratio is crucial.
